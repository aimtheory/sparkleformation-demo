This repo demonstrates infrastructure automation with Chef and AWS Cloudformation that employs the SparkleFormation library.

Two demo cookbooks, [org-nginx](site-cookbooks/org-nginx/README.md) and [org-mongodb](site-cookbooks/org-mongodb/README.md) show how Chef can be used for org-specific configurations.

[The README doc](cloudformation/README.md) for SparkleFormation explains in more detail how the AWS CloudFormation service can be utilized with the SparkleFormation library.
